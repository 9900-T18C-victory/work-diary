Work diary

Week 1
Group formed. I joined the Jira team, and I was selected to be the scrum master, we divided all the work successfully.
Week 2
We held a group meeting and discussed about the detailed contents in proposal. We talked about the functionalities and other functional novelties with respect to existing related systems. But we still got several questions left, need to ask our mentor for help. I worked out the system prototype and I'm working on the backlog as well as sprints.
